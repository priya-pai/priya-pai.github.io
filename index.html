		<p id="headdesc"> Hi there! I'm currently a senior at Columbia University, double majoring in English Literature and Computer Science. I was born and raised in Sugar Land, Texas (a land of warmth, sprawling grocery stores, and the best Tex Mex). I am passionate about writing, art, and community advocacy... and intersecting those passions with my skills in technology. I've held internships at the American Civil Liberties Union and Adobe and have gotten the chance to work on some pretty incredible projects. I was also recently named a <a href="https://research.adobe.com/scholarship/previous-scholarship-award-winners/"> 2019 Adobe Woman-in-Tech scholar</a>. I'm still figuring life out and exploring my interests like other college kids, but I am incredibly interested in data science, research, and anything that allows me to be creative AND analytical.
